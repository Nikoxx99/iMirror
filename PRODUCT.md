# Product

## Audience

- Students and laptop users with weak or broken webcams.
- Creators who want their phone camera in calls or browser tools.
- Developers who prefer local, inspectable workflows.
- Open-source contributors who want a clean camera bridge foundation.

## Primary Job

Turn a phone camera into a usable webcam through a local, trustworthy workflow:

```text
Phone -> iMirror Desktop -> iMirror Camera -> browser/app
```

## Personality

Technical, calm, precise, and elegant. iMirror should feel like a serious utility, not a generic SaaS dashboard.

## Anti-Goals

- Cloud accounts.
- Telemetry or tracking.
- Fake native camera claims.
- Complicated pairing.
- Confusing OBS setup.
- Decorative UI that competes with the video output.

## Current Truth

iMirror V2 can install an experimental Windows DirectShow camera named `iMirror Camera` using UnityCapture. The
current frame pump is WebView canvas -> Rust -> UnityCapture shared memory, so it is practical and testable but not the
final zero-copy native receiver.

OBS Output Mode remains as a fallback system-camera workflow.
