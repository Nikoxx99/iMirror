# Virtual Camera

Browsers and meeting apps only detect cameras registered by the operating system.

Windows V2:

- Experimental `iMirror Camera` DirectShow device through UnityCapture.
- Phone WebRTC stream reaches iMirror Desktop.
- Desktop pumps throttled RGBA frames into UnityCapture shared memory.
- Chrome/OBS/Zoom can open `iMirror Camera` after the driver is installed.

Install the Windows driver from an Administrator PowerShell:

```powershell
pnpm install:windows-camera
```

Test without OBS:

1. Start iMirror Desktop.
2. Connect your phone.
3. Open `TEST-CAMERAS.html` in Chrome.
4. Scan cameras.
5. Select `iMirror Camera`.
6. Start the selected camera.

Important behavior:

- The bridge starts streaming only after a target app opens `iMirror Camera`.
- If the status says waiting, keep the Chrome/OBS camera preview open for a few seconds.
- Restart Chrome after installing or uninstalling the driver.
- The current bridge uses a throttled WebView canvas pump, so it is a practical V2 bridge, not the final zero-copy native receiver.

OBS fallback:

- Desktop preview.
- OBS Output Mode for a clean capture-safe window surface.
- OBS Virtual Camera workflow for Windows/macOS/Linux.
- Mirror, fit/fill, rotate, and background controls in OBS Output Mode.

Use this fallback only if the DirectShow path is not installed or a target app refuses the virtual DirectShow device:

1. Connect your phone to iMirror Desktop.
2. Click Open OBS Output.
3. Open OBS Studio.
4. Add a Window Capture source for iMirror OBS Output.
5. Click Start Virtual Camera in OBS.
6. Refresh or restart Chrome.
7. Select OBS Virtual Camera in Chrome, Zoom, Discord, Meet, or another app.

If the browser preview feels reversed, toggle Mirror in OBS Output Mode before OBS captures it.

If iMirror is missing from OBS Window Capture:

1. Restart iMirror Desktop.
2. Keep the iMirror Desktop window open and unminimized.
3. Reopen the OBS Window Capture source properties.
4. Pick `[imirror-desktop.exe]: iMirror OBS Output`.
5. If it still does not appear, restart OBS or use Display Capture and crop to the iMirror preview.

If OBS shows `[imirror-desktop.exe]: iMirror Desktop`, you have not entered OBS Output Mode yet.

If OBS shows iMirror but the preview is black:

1. Restart iMirror Desktop after pulling the latest code.
2. In OBS Window Capture, try Windows Graphics Capture.
3. If it is still black, try Windows 10 (1903 and up), then BitBlt.
4. If both methods are black, use Display Capture and crop to the iMirror preview.

Future:

- A native receiver that avoids WebView canvas/base64 frame transport.
- Windows Media Foundation virtual camera research.
- Native macOS CoreMediaIO.
